<b style="font-weight: bold">Graph Construction:</b> It is an important step on Graph Convolutional Networks as connections between nodes (edges) act as the receptive field on conventional CNNs. Edges indicate the influence between nodes in the graph. Graph Construction can be seen as three different stages: a) Project RGB-D image to 3D space. If the input is a 3D point cloud, this step can be skipped. b) Create the connectivity between nodes. Two methods will be explored: Radius proximity connection and K< nearest neighbours (kNN). Both have the particularity that the edges are directed. c) Add attributes to each edge of the graph.<br /><br />

<b style="font-weight: bold">Attention Graph Convolution:</b> This operation performs convolutions over local graph neighbourhoods exploiting the attributes of the edges. An intuitive explanation of the proposal is that the lattice space that is needed to do a convolution is artificially created using edges. These edges have a direct influence on the weights of the filter used to calculate the convolution. Depending on the edge attribute a weight will be generated. This generation of weights is done by a Dynamic Filter Network which can be implemented with any differentiable architecture.<br/><br />

<b style="font-weight: bold">Residual Attention Graph Convolution:</b> The previous Attention Graph Convolution (AGC) is extended to a Residual Attention Graph Convolution (RAGC) following the inspiration of the ResNet architecture.<br /><br />

<b style="font-weight: bold">Pooling Graph Operation:</b> It is done using the Voxel downsample algorithm. It consists of creating voxels of resolution r over the point cloud and replacing all points inside the voxel with their centroid. The feature of the new point is the average or the maximum (depends on the kind of pooling done) of the features of the points inside the voxel. After the pooling operation is done, the graph is reconstructed from the downsampled 3D point cloud.<br /><br />
